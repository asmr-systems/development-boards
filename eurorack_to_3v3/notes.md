# Notes

## Debugging 2022.04.26
Still can't get the BH2227 DAC to work.
Strangely, the 74HC595 Output Registers are working, but the opamp circuit to amplify
isn't working correctly. a high 3v3 output is ATTENTUATED (not amplified....)
need to debug this on a breadboard.

## Soldering Progress 2022.03.04
finished all R1k
partial progress on R100k (up to R39)

## Soldering Progress 2022.03.06
finished all resistors
next capacitors then ICs

## Soldering Progress 2022.03.07
finished everything excerpt ICs,
stopped after U2
